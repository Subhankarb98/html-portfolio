    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Football - both watching and playing! My favourite position is CAM ;) and my favourite team is Man Utd :'(</li>
        <li>Gaming - I am pretty competitive. I have taken part in Dota 2 and Counter Strike tournaments when I was in college. If you've played Dota, you must already like me :)</li>
        <li>Music - love listening to music! Mostly retro and indie (both Hindi and English) artists like AC/DC, Pink Floyd (favourite), Muhammad Rafi, The Strokes. I spend some time every week trying to replicate the works of Slash or David Gilmour on my guitar. Man, do I make a fool out of myself :P</li>
